# Dashboard research tree

The dashboard shows where a run is on the game's research tree. It reads the tree
from the running game, so each version gets its own: Factorio 1.1 (older FLE
setups), 2.0.x, and 2.0 with Space Age. Nothing in the dashboard names a
technology.

## What it shows

- **Research strip** (top bar): the technology being researched and its
  progress, or the trigger for 2.0 trigger technologies ("Craft 10 × iron gear
  wheel"); how many technologies on the path are done per science pack; and the
  overall count to the goal, with how many are available to research now.
- **Current objective**: the controller's goals around research milestones.
  Milestones are the game's own `essential` technologies on the path (2.0+), or
  the science-pack unlocks and the goal on 1.1, where `essential` doesn't exist.

The **path** is every technology the goal depends on:

| Game | Goal | Milestones |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1 | `rocket-silo` | science packs (red is "from start"), rocket silo |
| 2.0 base | `rocket-silo` | essential technologies on the path; military science is essential but not needed for the silo, so it is left out |
| 2.0 + Space Age | every essential technology | science packs, rocket silo, planet discoveries, through promethium science |

Tiers group technologies by the most advanced science pack they need. Pack order
comes from the depth of the technology that unlocks each pack. Trigger
technologies take the tier of their prerequisites. Infinite and hidden
technologies are never on the path.

## Where the data comes from

`lua/research_catalog.lua` is a read-only RCON script. It detects the Lua API
generation (1.1 `game.*_prototypes`/`global`, or 2.0 `prototypes`/`storage`/
`helpers`) and reads every member through `pcall`, because members differ between
versions. It exports the tree plus the agent force's research state as
`jev.research.v1` JSON.

It reaches the dashboard as a sidecar file, `research-catalog.json`:

- **This controller (FLE backend):** written next to `--log-file` (or
  `--dashboard-events`) at startup. It is best effort: a failure prints a warning
  and never affects the run.
- **Any other FLE or RCON setup, including 1.1.110:** run the exporter yourself.
  `--watch` keeps the research state fresh when no controller telemetry carries
  it:

  ```
  JEV_RCON_PASSWORD=... python -m jev_factorio.research_catalog \
      --host 127.0.0.1 --port 27015 --out research-catalog.json [--watch 10]
  ```

The dashboard looks for `research-catalog.json` next to its telemetry file
(override with `--research-catalog`) and reloads it when it changes.
Controller telemetry (`researched`, and the factory's current research) is
preferred over the sidecar's own state. If telemetry names a technology the tree
doesn't have, the strip is hidden ("version mismatch") and the fixed milestone
list is shown instead. Trees from different versions are never mixed.

## Icons

`--icon-dir` may hold one folder per game version. The dashboard serves
`<icon-dir>/<version>/<name>.png` first, then `<icon-dir>/<name>.png`. Take icons
from the matching game install (`data/base/graphics/icons`, plus
`data/space-age/graphics/icons` for Space Age). They are Wube assets; don't
commit them. Missing icons fall back to a colour for each known pack and to text
elsewhere.
